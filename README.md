Global App State Management for SwiftUI Applications.

Not to be confused with a completely unrelated, amazing state management library [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Example app shows how to create a store, use actions, compose your App's state via reducers, and finally how to wire that in to your SwiftUI View for automatic re-rendering

So much more to do, action creators, async dispatch support, middleware, tests, Swift package manager support etc.
